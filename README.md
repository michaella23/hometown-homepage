# Hometown Homepage

## The setup

This is the first solo project in Scrimba's frontend career path, which is also featured in the **Learn HTML & CSS for Free** course. The goal is to build a web page from scratch and demonstrate knowledge of HTML and CSS fundamentals such as background-image, flexbox, border-radius, class names and semantic HTML. The design is based on a Figma file, and coders are encouraged to match the design specs and the color palette.

## How it Went

For me, this was a back-to-basics project. As a code reviewer for other students who complete this project, I wanted to build this solo project to have a good understanding of what challenges new coders might face. I was able to build it very quickly actually, which was a nice reminder of how far I have come since I started teaching myself to code.

## Ways to take it further

I only fulfilled the basic requirements for this project, but at some point I would like to personalize this more. I will make this about my own Hometown, and perhaps change up the design using different fonts, colors and pictures.
